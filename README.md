# NFS-TypeWriter

A fast typing multiplayer game.

User can create a new game and share an invite link to his / her friends.
Players can join a game. After the timer starts players can start competing.
Players can see the position and progress of their peers in realtime. I have used colors for show the progress of players in real-time.

I have used websockets for this realtime duplex communication. Websockets are used to connect sockets for realtime communications. In this game the positions of players have to be communicated to each other in real-time. Socket.io is a library which provides easy to use implementation of websockets with powerful features.
